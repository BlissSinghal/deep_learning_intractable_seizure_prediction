# deep_learning_intractable_seizure_prediction
Conducted research to create a novel and comprehensive framework for scalable seizure prediction with Unimodal Neuroimaging Data in Pediatric Patients. I explored Bandpass filtering, Independent Component Analysis, and Deep Learning Algorithms like LSTM, CNN, and RNN.
